## Adding another plugin

1. Create `plugins/<my-plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (`name`, `description`, `author`).
2. Put the plugin's content next to it — a skill in `plugins/<my-plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, commands in `commands/`, agents in `agents/`.
3. Add an entry to the `plugins` array in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `source` pointing at `./plugins/<my-plugin>`.
4. Commit and push. Users refresh with `/plugin marketplace update kros-plugins`.
